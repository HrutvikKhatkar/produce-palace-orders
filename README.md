# Bulk Vegetable/Fruit Ordering Platform

A web application that facilitates bulk vegetable/fruit orders, allowing buyers to browse products, place bulk orders, and track order status. Admins can manage orders and inventory efficiently.

## Features

### For Buyers:
- **Browse Products**: View a catalog of available vegetables/fruits with basic details (name, price per unit).
- **Place Orders**: Buyers can place bulk orders specifying item name, quantity, and delivery details (name, contact, address).
- **Track Orders**: Buyers can track the status of their orders (Pending, In Progress, Delivered).

### For Admins:
- **Order Management**: View and manage orders, with the ability to update the status of orders.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, edit, and remove products from the catalog.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (or Express/Flask)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon.tech (or Docker containerized Postgres)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (preferred) or Netlify

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bulk-ordering-platform.git
cd bulk-ordering-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` file. You will need to add your database URL and any other configuration values.

Example `.env`:
```ini
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

### 4. Run the Application Locally
Now that the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set, you can run the application locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

### 5. Database Setup
If you are using Docker, you can set up the PostgreSQL database container by following these steps:

- Build the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose build
```
- Run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 6. Running Migrations
After setting up the database, you will need to run the migrations to set up the necessary schema for the application. You can run the migrations with:
```bash
npm run migrate
```
This will ensure that the database tables for products, orders, and order statuses are created.

### 7. Deployment
Once the project is set up and ready, you can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify.

- Push your project code to a GitHub repository.
- Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel/Netlify and follow the deployment steps.

Both Vercel and Netlify will automatically handle your environment variables and database connections.

### 8. Accessing the Deployed Application
After deployment, you can access your app through the provided URL on Vercel or Netlify. If you used Vercel, for example, it will look something like this: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## API Endpoints

### For Buyers:
- **GET** `/api/products`: Fetch the list of products in the catalog.
- **POST** `/api/orders`: Place a new order (requires item name, quantity, and delivery details).
- **GET** `/api/orders/:orderId`: Get the current status of an order.

### For Admins:
- **PUT** `/api/orders/:orderId/status`: Update the order status (Pending → In Progress → Delivered).
- **POST** `/api/products`: Add a new product to the catalog.
- **PUT** `/api/products/:productId`: Edit an existing product.
- **DELETE** `/api/products/:productId`: Remove a product from the catalog.

## Bonus Features (Optional)
- **Authentication**: Admin login with JWT authentication.
- **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications to buyers on order status updates.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for API/database configurations.

## Project Structure
- **pages/**: Contains the pages of the Next.js app (product catalog, order form, admin dashboard).
- **components/**: Reusable UI components (e.g., product card, order form).
- **lib/**: Utility functions (e.g., database connections, API handlers).
- **styles/**: CSS/SCSS styles.

## Database Schema
- **Products**: Stores product details like name and price.
- **Orders**: Stores order details including item names, quantities, and delivery information.
- **Order Status**: Tracks the status of orders (Pending, In Progress, Delivered).

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: Complete implementation of buyer and admin features.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
- **Database Design**: Well-structured schema for products and orders.
- **UI/UX**: Clean and responsive interface for a smooth user experience.
- **Bonus Features**: Additional features such as email notifications and authentication.
